================= Version 2.1.2: Released January 25, 2007 ===================
==============================================================================
1) BUG FIXES
   a) Subroutine mapout.F edited to add a statement which writes the boundary
      value arrays nijb1 and nojb1 to the restart files.  These writes had 
      been erroneously omitted in previous releases. (Perversely, the corres-
      ponding READ statements in mapin.F were already present.)
   b) Subroutine restart.F was edited so that the (unnecessary) call to NUDT
      was commented out.  The restart files already contain the value of dt
      that should be used at startup; this call to NUDT overwrites that value.

2) NEW FEATURES:  zip, zero, nada.

================= Version 2.1.1: Released December 21, 2006 ==================
==============================================================================
1) BUG FIXES

   a) Subroutines LORENTZ_2D and LORENTZ were edited to correct a typo in a
      metric factor used to compute accelerations for the 3-velocity.
      ZEUS-MP 1.0b USERS NOTE: this bug was inherited from ZEUS-3D and is
      also present in Version 1.0b!
   b) Subroutine FORCES was edited to correct a typo in the computation of
      corrections to the 2-velocity due to rotational pseudoforces.
      ZEUS-MP 1.0b USERS NOTE: this bug was inherited from ZEUS-3D and is
      also present in Version 1.0b!
   c) Subroutines CT, CT_1D, and CT_2D were edited to extend the ranges of
      the [i,j,k] DO loops that copy the v[1,2,3] field arrays into the local
      u[1,2,3] scratch arrays.  This avoids passing uninitialized u[1,2,3]
      data in the BVALV[1,2,3] subroutines.
   d) Subroutine FORCES was edited to implement Sean Matt's
      corrections to components of the point-mass potential in RTP geometry.
   e) Subroutine GGEN was edited to implement Matthias Vigelius's corrections
      to DO loops 36, 136, and 236.  The original versions resulted in an incorrect
      assignment of ratioed grids when such grids are distributed across multiple
      processors.
   f) Subroutine MOMX2 was edited to "re-roll" the I-loops and to correct a
      bug in the "sflx" formula that manifested itself on reflecting 2-boundaries
      in spherical geometry.
   g) Subroutine CONFIGURE was edited so that the open statement for unit 1 was
      moved after the initialization commands for MPI, and an "if(myid_w .eq. 0)"
      condition was prepended to the open command.
   h) Subroutine MSTART was edited to prepend an "if(myid_w .eq. 0)" condition
      to the CLOSE statement for unit 1 (zmp_inp).
   i) Subroutine PDV was edited to add an "IMPLICIT NONE" statement and a
      declaration for variable div_v
   j) Subroutine STREAM was edited to correct an indexing error for the case
      of idirect=3.
   k) Subroutines ZEUSMP, INTCHK, and file MOD_FILES were tweaked for the case
      of ARCH_CRAY defined in the Makefile.  This allows the timing routines
      to work on a Cray XT3 (Jaguar at ORNL).

2) NEW FEATURES

   None. Zip. Zero. Nada.

==================== Version 2.1.0: Released May 23, 2006 ====================
==============================================================================
1) BUG FIXES

   a) Subroutines CT, CT_1D, CT_2D, and LORENTZ_D edited to correct a memory
      referencing error in which two arrays were assigned the same space in
      memory.  ZEUS-MP 1.0b USERS NOTE: this bug was inherited from Version
      1.0b.
   b) Subroutine FORCES edited to correct an error in the k-indexing of 
      array "derdx3" in the evaluation of radiation forces for the 2-velocity.

2) NEW FEATURES: HDF5 SUPPORT INTRODUCED.

   a) The subroutine HDFALL, which writes HDF-based output files for visualization,
      now comes in three versions (all contained within file hdfall.F), depending
      upon the specification of an appropriate CPP macro in the ZMP_CPP line
      of the Makefile.

   b) Subroutines MSAVE and MGET (contained in file msave.F), which write
      restart files, can now be configured to write those files in HDF5 format
      rather than native binary if the appropriate CPP macro is defined in
      the Makefile.

   c) The logical parameters XHDF4 and XHDF5 in zmp_inp namelist IOCONF have
      been replaced with a single switch, XHDF.  All example zmp_inp namelists
      in directory zeusmp2/test have been modified accordingly.  The restart
      file parameter, XRESTART, has been left unchanged.  When either XRESTART
      or XHDF is set to .TRUE., restart and/or visualization files will be
      read/written according to whether HDF or HDF5 was selected at compilation
      time, based upon CPP macros described below.

      *** YOU WILL NEED TO EDIT YOUR OWN ZMP_INP NAMELISTS TO REMOVE XHDF4 AND
          XHDF5 AND REPLACE THEM WITH XHDF!!! ***

   d) Rules for defining the CPP macros are as follows:
      i) Adding "-DUSE_HDF4" to ZMP_CPP configures hdfall.F and msave.F in the
         traditional fashion: subroutine HDFALL writes HDF files and subroutines
         MSAVE/MGET write/read restart files in binary format.
      ii) Adding "-DUSE_HDF5" to ZMP_CPP configures subroutines HDFALL and
          MSAVE/MGET for HDF5 format.
      iii) Omitting both USE_HDF4 and USE_HDF5 causes subroutines MSAVE/MGET
           to adopt the traditional binary format for restart files.
      iv) Omitting both USE_HDF4 and USE_HDF5 causes subroutine HDFALL to
          be configured as an empty routine.

      *** HEY!! THIS NEXT ONE IS REALLY IMPORTANT!! ***

      v) If both USE_HDF4 and USE_HDF5 are defined in the Makefile, the code
         thus compiled will print an error message to TTY and abort.
